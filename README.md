# Annual-Stock-Market-Returns

Summary: My goal here was to create a bar chart that shows the annual historical returns of the S&P 500 over the past 10 years. As you can see below, there were only two years (2015 and 2018) out of ten where the annual return % was negative. From a long-term standpoint, studies show that on average the stock market returns at least 10% -- this can be a good return for investors who have the mental stamina to play the long game, as timing the market can be very difficult. However, with the current state of the economy, inflation can surely eat into those returns so one must be sure to factor that into their analysis.
